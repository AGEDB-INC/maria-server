# Build and Debug from source (Ubuntu 22.04)

## Install Dependencies
Firstly Create configuration file in this path '/etc/apt/sources.list.d/mariadb.list` using following command:

```
sudo gedit /etc/apt/sources.list.d/mariadb.list
```

then Save the following repository configuration contents in the file `/etc/apt/sources.list.d/mariadb.list`. Note that the configuration is valid for the mariadb branch 11.0 and Ubuntu 22.04:
```
# Retrieved from: https://mariadb.org/download/?t=repo-config

# MariaDB 11.0 [RC] repository list - created 2023-02-24 18:43 UTC
# https://mariadb.org/download/
deb https://mirror.its.dal.ca/mariadb/repo/11.0/ubuntu jammy main
deb-src https://mirror.its.dal.ca/mariadb/repo/11.0/ubuntu jammy main
deb https://mirror.its.dal.ca/mariadb/repo/11.0/ubuntu jammy main/debug
```

Install dependencies:
```
sudo apt-get install software-properties-common \
      devscripts \
      equivs \
      curl \
      git
sudo apt-get build-dep mariadb-server
```

Import the repository key and update apt. You should not get any error from the mariadb repository server:

```
sudo curl -o /etc/apt/trusted.gpg.d/mariadb_release_signing_key.asc 'https://mariadb.org/mariadb_release_signing_key.asc'
sudo apt-get update

```



## Build

Make sure you completed the previous steps without any failure before moving forward.

We will be working on 3 main directories `maria-server` (source directory), `maria-server-build` (build directory), and `maria-server-data` (data directory). You can choose any names. We will create them inside the home directory. You can choose any directory where root privilige is not required.
```
cd ~
```

Fork and, then clone the forked repo:

```
git clone https://github.com/{your-username}/maria-server
```

Create the build and data directory.
```
mkdir ~/maria-server-build
mkdir ~/maria-server-data
```

Run the following commands to start building. Notice the directory used in each command:
```
cd ~/maria-server-build
cmake ~/maria-server/ -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug
cmake --build ./ -j8
```

## Configure

Before proceeding, you should have mariadb installed without any error from cmake.

Copy the following mariadb configuration into the file `~/.my.cnf`. Set the absolute path to your data and build directory in the `datadir` and `language` entry before saving:
```
# Example MariadB config file.
# You can copy this to one of:
# /etc/my.cnf to set global options,
# /mysql-data-dir/my.cnf to get server specific options or
# ~/my.cnf for user specific options.
#
# One can use all long options that the program supports.
# Run the program with --help to get a list of available options

# This will be passed to all MariaDB clients
[client]
#password=my_password
#port=3306
#socket=/tmp/mysql.sock

# Here is entries for some specific programs
# The following values assume you have at least 32M ram

# The mariadb server  (both [mysqld] and [mariadb] works here)
[mariadb]
#port=3306
#socket=/tmp/mysql.sock

# The following three entries caused mysqld 10.0.1-MariaDB (and possibly other versions) to abort...
# skip-locking
# set-variable  = key_buffer=16M

loose-innodb_data_file_path = ibdata1:1000M
loose-mutex-deadlock-detector
gdb

######### Fix the two following paths

# Where you want to have your database
datadir={absolute-path-to-your-data-directory}

# Where you have your mysql/MariaDB source + sql/share/english
language={absolute-path-to-your-build-directory}/sql/share/english

########## One can also have a different path for different versions, to simplify development.

[mariadb-10.1]
lc-messages-dir=/my/maria-10.1/sql/share

[mariadb-10.2]
lc-messages-dir=/my/maria-10.2/sql/share

[mysqldump]
quick
set-variable = max_allowed_packet=16M

[mysql]
no-auto-rehash

[myisamchk]
set-variable= key_buffer=128M
```

Initialize data files in the data direcotry:
```
cd ~/maria-server-build
./scripts/mariadb-install-db --srcdir={absolute-path-to-your-source-directory} --user=$LOGNAME
```

## Run

Check whether the install was successful:
```
./sql/mariadbd
```

You should see something similar to this in the terminal:
```
...
...
2023-02-24 14:37:06 0 [Note] ./sql/mariadbd: ready for connections.
Version: '11.0.1-MariaDB-debug'  socket: '/tmp/mysql.sock'  port: 3306  Source distribution
```

Shutdown the server using `CTRL + C`.

While the server was running, you could also run the client using `./client/mariadb` to test SQL commands.

## Debug (GDB)

Run gdb and the server with debug flag:
```
gdb -tui --args ./sql/mariadbd --gdb
```

Inside gdb, set breakpoint at the `write_row` function. This function is likely used by the sql INSERT command:
```
b write_row
```

Start the server within gdb:
```
run
```

In a separate terminal, run the client:
```
./client/mariadb
```

Set up a sample table:
```
CREATE DATABASE mydb;
USE mydb;
CREATE TABLE mytable (id int);
```

Insert a row into mytable. If gdb is setup correctly, the INSERT command will pause the client and trigger the breakpoint in the `ha_innobase::write_row` function.
```
INSERT INTO mytable VALUES ('1');
```

## Debug (VSCode)

Use the following launch configuration. Make sure to set the build directory in the `program` entry. It should configure the default C\C++ extension to launch mariadb with debug flag:
```
"configurations": [
    ...,
    ...,
    {
        "name": "(gdb) Launch",
        "type": "cppdbg",
        "request": "launch",
        "program": "{absolute-path-to-your-build-directory}/sql/mariadbd",
        "args": ["--gdb", "--debug"],
        "stopAtEntry": false,
        "cwd": "${fileDirname}",
        "environment": [],
        "externalConsole": false,
        "MIMode": "gdb",
        "setupCommands": [
            {
                "description": "Enable pretty-printing for gdb",
                "text": "-enable-pretty-printing",
                "ignoreFailures": true
            },
            {
                "description": "Set Disassembly Flavor to Intel",
                "text": "-gdb-set disassembly-flavor intel",
                "ignoreFailures": true
            }
        ]
    }
]
```

Launch the server from the VSCode's Run and Debug tab. You can set breakpoints from the IDE's text editor. But, you have to run the sql commands from the client as shown in the previous section.

## Rebuild

If you want to rebuild, first go the the source directory and run this command:
```
cd ~/maria-server
git clean -xffd && git submodule foreach --recursive git clean -xffd
```

Then, follow all the previous steps from the beginning.

## RESEARCH

## Buffer Pool

Buffer pool is an in-memory cache used for faster access to frequently accessed data. It stores data and indexes reducing disk I/O.

### Working of Buffer Pool

Buffer pool mechanism works on the the two sublist concepts the **new sublist** and the **old sublist** where every item when accessed first time gets on the top of old sublist and on being called while in the old sublist moves to the top of new sublist. By default **37%** of space is reserved for old-block. 

The mechanism of moving tuples out of the new sublist and old sublist is same as both of them works on the LRU algorithm. Once the block moves from old sublist to the head of new sublist then all the previously present blocks in new sublist move one step below and if the new sublist reaches its capacity then the least recently used block from new sublist moves to the head of old sublist.

### Size of Buffer Pool

The size of the buffer pool is determined by **innodb_buffer_pool_size** system variable. The size of buffer pool should be adjusted per your needs to see the best performance. In order to configure the size of buffer pool set **innodb_buffer_pool_size** system variable, the InnoDB Buffer Pool should usually be between 50%-75% of the memory available.

#### 2 ways to configure size of buffer pool

1) The size of the InnoDB buffer pool can be changed dynamically by setting the innodb_buffer_pool_size system variable using the SET GLOBAL statement which requires SUPER privilege.

2)Changing the size of buffer pool by setting **innodb_buffer_pool_size** system variable in configuration file. Ensure that your custom configuration file is read last by using the z- prefix in the file name so that changes made by you are not overwritten. 
innodb_buffer_pool_size system variable in the configuration file.
**innodb_buffer_pool_size** needs to be set in a group that will be read by MariaDB Server, such as [mariadb] or [server]. When set in a configuration file, the value supports units such as "M" (Megabyte), "G" (Gigabyte), etc. For this method server restart is needed to reflect the changes.

### Saving And Restoring Buffer Pool State

Innodb stores some percentage of most recently used pages from buffer pool at server shutdown and restores them at server restart. This is managed by **innodb_buffer_pool_dump_pct** configuration option which is used to reduce warmup period.
**innodb_buffer_pool_dump_at_shutdown** and **innodb_buffer_pool_load_at_startup** system variables should be enabled to allow buffer pool dump at shutdown and restore at server restart.

#### Some Important Points Related to Buffer Pool

* Pages are evicted using a least recently used (LRU) algorithm.

* InnoDB reserves additional memory for buffers and control structures, so that the total allocated space is approximately 10% greater than the specified buffer pool size.

* The size of each page in the Buffer Pool depends on the value of the **innodb_page_size** system variable.
